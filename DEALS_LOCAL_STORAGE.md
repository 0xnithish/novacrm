# Deals Local Storage Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive local storage solution for managing deals (both active and closed) in the CRM application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Custom Hook: `useDeals` (`hooks/useDeals.ts`)
A centralized hook for managing all deals with the following features:

- **Persistent Storage**: Automatically saves deals to localStorage
- **Default Data**: Includes sample deals if no data exists in localStorage
- **State Management**: Uses React hooks for reactive state updates
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - `addDeal`: Add a new deal (active or closed)
  - `updateDeal`: Update an existing deal
  - `deleteDeal`: Remove a deal
  - `getActiveDeals`: Filter and return only active deals
  - `getClosedDeals`: Filter and return only closed deals

### 2. Deal Interface
```typescript
interface Deal {
  id: string
  title: string
  clientName: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  amount: string
  leadOwner?: string
  location?: string
  referralPartner?: string
  annualIncome?: string
  progressPercentage?: number
  closedDate?: string
  status: 'active' | 'closed'
  activities?: Activity[]
  notes?: Note[]
}
```

### 3. Updated Pages

#### Active Deals (`app/deals/active/page.tsx`)
- **Integrated with `useDeals` hook**
- **Add New Deal Modal**: Form to create new active deals
- **Dynamic Table**: Displays all active deals from localStorage
- **Auto-save**: New deals are automatically saved to localStorage
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately when deals are added

#### Closed Deals (`app/deals/closed/page.tsx`)
- **Integrated with `useDeals` hook**
- **Add Closed Deal Modal**: Form to create new closed deals with a closed date field
- **Dynamic Table**: Displays all closed deals from localStorage
- **Auto-save**: New closed deals are automatically saved to localStorage
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately when deals are added

#### Main Deals Page (`app/deals/page.tsx`)
- **Dynamic Statistics**: Shows real-time counts of total, active, and closed deals
- **Auto-updates**: Stats update automatically when deals are added/removed

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Add some deals via the forms

4. Look for `crm_deals` key to see stored data
5. Navigate between pages to see real-time count updates
